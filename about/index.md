Sarah Schulte is a software engineer with **5 years** industry experience and an indie game developer.

She particularly enjoys playing tennis, pondering game design, and playing rhythm games (currently, mostly addicted to _Beat Saber_).

She also occasionally likes to stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/badcop_) and write bad code (see: [rolly cubes](https://github.com/cgsdev0/rollycubes)).

## Currently...
